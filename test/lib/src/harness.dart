/// Manages application lifecycle for the purpose of testing the application.
///
/// You install a test harness at the beginning of a test's `main` function. Before test cases are run,
/// the harness starts an instance of your application on the same isolate as the tests. After your tests complete,
/// the harness stops the application from running.
///
/// You typically create a subclass of [TestHarness] that is used for all tests in an application. The subclass
/// overrides callbacks [beforeStart] and [afterStart] to configure the application. This configuration might be
/// adding an application's database schema to a test database, or to create OAuth2 client identifiers
/// for use during test. See also [TestHarnessORMMixin] and [TestHarnessAuthMixin] for adding common behaviors
/// like these to your harness.
///
/// Usage:
///
///         class Harness extends ApplicationHarness<MyChannel> {
///           @override
///           Future afterStart() async {
///             channel.service.uri = Uri.parse("http://localhost:4040");
///           }
///         }
///
///         void main() {
///           final harness = Harness()..install();
///
///           test("GET /example returns 200", () async {
///             final response = await harness.agent.get("/example");
///             expectResponse(response, 200);
///           });
///         }
